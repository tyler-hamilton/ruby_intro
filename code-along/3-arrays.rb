# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream", "sushi"]
# puts favorite_foods

we_have_to_go_back = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back

mixed_array = ["tacos", 3, true]
# puts mixed_array

# Accessing the array

puts favorite_foods [0]
puts favorite_foods [1]
puts favorite_foods [2]
puts favorite_foods [3]
puts favorite_foods [4]

# Add to the array
favorite_foods.push "coffee"
puts favorite_foods
